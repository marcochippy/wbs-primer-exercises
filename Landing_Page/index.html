    <h1>Find your new best friend!</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to <strong>Paws & Reflect</strong>, where every dog has a tale
      (and a tail) to tell! We’re not just an adoption agency—we’re matchmakers
      for humans and their future fur-babies. Whether you’re looking for a couch
      potato or a zoomie enthusiast, we’ve got the perfect pup to complete your
      pack. Our dogs are pre-loved, pre-trained (mostly), and pre-approved for
      maximum cuddles. Adopt from us, and you’ll get a best friend who’s always
      happy to see you, even if you just left to take out the trash. 🐾
    </p>

    <h2>About Us!</h2>
    <p>
      At <strong>Paws & Reflect</strong>, we believe every dog deserves a second
      chance (and maybe a second breakfast). We’re a team of passionate dog
      lovers who’ve made it our mission to connect wagging tails with happy
      homes. From scruffy scamps to regal retrievers, we rescue, rehabilitate,
      and rehome pups with love, care, and the occasional belly rub. Our goal?
      To make the world a better place, one wet nose and wagging tail at a time.
      Because life’s better with a dog—preferably one who thinks your lap is
      their throne.
