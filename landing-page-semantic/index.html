        <h1>Find your new best friend! 🐾</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to <strong>Paws & Reflect</strong>, where every dog has a tale
          (and a tail) to tell! We’re not just an adoption agency—we’re
          matchmakers for humans and their future fur-babies. Whether you’re
          looking for a couch potato or a zoomie enthusiast, we’ve got the
          perfect pup to complete your pack. Our dogs are pre-loved, pre-trained
          (mostly), and pre-approved for maximum cuddles. Adopt from us, and
          you’ll get a best friend who’s always happy to see you, even if you
          just left to take out the trash.

        <h2>About Us! 🙋‍♂️🙋‍♀️</h2>
        <p>
          At <strong>Paws & Reflect</strong>, we believe every dog deserves a
          second chance (and maybe a second breakfast). We’re a team of
          passionate dog lovers who’ve made it our mission to connect wagging
          tails with happy homes. From scruffy scamps to regal retrievers, we
          rescue, rehabilitate, and rehome pups with love, care, and the
          occasional belly rub. Our goal? To make the world a better place, one
          wet nose and wagging tail at a time. Because life’s better with a
          dog—preferably one who thinks your lap is their throne.
