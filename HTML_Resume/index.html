        co-founding the technology company Apple Inc. Jobs was also the founder
        of NeXT and chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar. He was a pioneer
        of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with
        his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.

        <p>
          Apple's iMac G3 was introduced in 1998 and its innovative design is
          directly the result of Jobs's return to Apple. Apple boasted "the back
          of our computer looks better than the front of anyone else's".
          Described as "cartoonlike", the first iMac, clad in Bondi Blue
          plastic, was unlike any personal computer that came before.

          The first generation of iPod was released October 23, 2001. The major
          innovation of the iPod was its small size achieved by using a 1.8"
          hard drive compared to the 2.5" drives common to players at that time.
          The capacity of the first-generation iPod ranged from 5 GB to 10 GB.

          Apple began work on the first iPhone in 2005 and the first iPhone was
          released on June 29, 2007. The iPhone created such a sensation that a
          survey indicated six out of ten Americans were aware of its release.
          Time declared it "Invention of the Year" for 2007 and included it in
          the All-TIME 100 Gadgets list in 2010, in the category of
          Communication.
